Change Video Quality
--------------------

* I don't think there's a keyboard hotkey to increase/decrease the video quality
* The best I can do at the moment is use the <tab>, shift-<tab> to navigate to
  the settings GEAR icon.  Then press <Enter>, then down-arrow to `Quality`, 
  then <Enter>, then up/down arrow to the desired quality, then <Enter> to select.
