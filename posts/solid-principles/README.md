## S - Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. One class should only serve one purpose.

## O - Open/Closed Principle

Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Software
should be extendable without changing the contents of the class you’re 
extending. Inheritance

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle

A child class can be used where ever the parent is used.


## I - Interface Segregation Principle

A Client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use. Interfaces should be broken into many smaller ones.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low- 
level modules High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both 
should depend on abstractions.
