# git - How to sync fork with upstream repo?

git remote add upstream https://github.com/user/repo.git
git pull upstream master

# Upstream can be directly pulled

git pull https://github.com/user/repo.git master

git fetch works too.


# If the local repo has files that are newer than the upstream repo,
# then the new files will NOT be replaced.  Use a hard reset to match
# the same versions as the upstream repo.

git reqset --hard upstream/master
